# Ball-Balancing-Robot
ENPM662 Project: Modeling and simulation of Ball Balancing robot for a circular and straight line trajectory

# Introduction
The ball balancing robot is a dynamically stable robot, balancing itself about a single wheel, or sphere. Due to its design, the robot is omni-directional. This project deals with the kinematic and dynamic modeling of the robot. The dynamic model was developed using Euler-Lagrange equations. 
The robot was simulated in V-Rep, using a simple controller. It was able to execute the circular and straight line trajectories.
